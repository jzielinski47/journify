# Journify
Journify is your personal vechicle assistant. If you ever planned a journey or a trip or a voyage or whatever, you have probably encountered multiple issues. With this app you will save time to do all the unnecessary stuff since the app will provide you with a map, a spotify integration, a list of necessary items you need to take with you, a to do list, a list of all the places you need to visit, a backpack feature, a reminder feature, a gas oil pricess feature and all the other features you need before a journey. Take a ride!

## Project Setup

To start the project you need to open the client and the server directory separately in two different terminals. Run the server with `npm start`. Run the client with `npm run dev` for developer version.
